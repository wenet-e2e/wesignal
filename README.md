# wesignal
Production first, nn-based on-device signal processing toolkit.

`wesignal` is a full-stack signal processing toolkit. We will provide support for standard data simulation, datasets, and training recipes. Additionally, we will offer C/C++ runtime implementations for various hardware or platforms.

## Support List:
* ANS: Adaptive noise suppression
* AEC: Acoustic echo cancellation
* AGC: Automatic gain control
* Speech Seperation
* ...(TBD, open for proposals)
